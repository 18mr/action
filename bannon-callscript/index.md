## You're being connected!

Youâ€™ll recieve a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- Ask where the Senator or Representative stands on Stephen Bannon's White House appointment.
- *If they oppose Stephen Bannon's appointment,* thank them for their support.
- *If they have no position or support Stephen Bannon's appointment,* let the staffer know that white supremacy and bigotry have no place so close to the Oval Office, and that as a (woman, Muslim, Jewish, Black, Asian American, Latinx, disabled, LGBTQ...) constituent you are horrified that his influence could shape the next four years.
- Encorage the Senator or Representative to speak out against the appointment.
- Emphasize that people like Bannon are a threat to huge numbers of U.S. residents and we cannot let this appointment, or others like it, slide.
- Thank them for their time.

Thank you for your support!

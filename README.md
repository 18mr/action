# This is 18MR's new action site.

It is a Jekyll site that is designed with custom wrappers for Action Network petitions. It is sleek, modern, and much more readable than our last one. And, it's responsive!

The real live version is hosted elsewhere. Check it out at http://action.18mr.org

## TODO

- automatic social media share generation for "call" pages
- header handler for "call" page javascript

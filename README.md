# This is 18MR's new action site.

It is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site that is designed with custom wrappers for [Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) petitions. It is sleek, modern, and much more readable than our last one. And, it's responsive!

We are working on making it _even prettier_. Please let us know how we can do that by submitting an issue.

The real live version is hosted elsewhere. Check out what we're up to at http://action.18mr.org

## TODO

These are known issues that need to be resolved at some point.

- make the donation page prettier

# 18MR ACTION

This is the temporary home of templates, wrappers, and other goodies for campaigning at 18MR on the new stack. We will be making some changes over the next couple of months to how we build campaigns. This allows us to campaign using the new toolset without a complete overhaul of our website; that will be coming later in 2015!

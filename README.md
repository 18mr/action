# This is 18MR's new action site.

It is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site that is designed with custom wrappers for [Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) petitions. It is sleek, modern, and much more readable than our last one. And, it's responsive!

We are working on making it _even prettier_. Please let us know how we can do that by submitting an issue.

The real live version is hosted elsewhere. Check out what we're up to at http://action.18mr.org

## TODO

These are known issues that need to be resolved at some point.

- make the donation page prettier

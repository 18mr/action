## You're being connected!

Youâ€™ll receive a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Hi, my name is _____ and I am a resident of (State). 
- I am calling to ask DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to do ALL they can to stop the deportation of:

- Ched Nin A# 027-748-975

- Sameth Nhean A# 027-737-992

- These are Minnesota community members facing imminent deportation to Cambodia where many of them have never stepped foot or speak the language. These individuals have served their time and pose no threat to our communities. They are loving husbands, fathers, brothers and sons and their families need them home for the holidays.

Thank you for your support!

## You're being connected! If you don't receive a call, call 202-798-1373!

You’ll receive a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- You can share with your Senators:
Your or a loved one’s personal story of why the ACA is important to you
That more than 32 million Americans would lose access to healthcare if the ACA is repealed under Graham-Cassidy
14 million people will be kicked off Medicaid, and 17% of all Asian Americans and 34% of all Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders will lose this coverage.
Since passing the ACA, the uninsured rate for AAs and NHPIs has been cut by 50%



- And then: Urge them to vote No on the ACA repeal and No on Graham-Cassidy.

Thank you for your support!

## When you're done...

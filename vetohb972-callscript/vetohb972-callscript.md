__Here's a call script to reference during your conversation with Governor McCrory's office.__

<div class="featurebox">
<ul class="script">
<li>Iâ€™m calling to ask Governor McCrory to veto House Bill 972.</li>
<li>Police recordings need to stay public. City municipalities should decide whether to release body camera and dash camera footage, not police departments. If HB 972 passes, police departments will be able to deny the requests and will even be able to pick parts relevant to the request to be viewed or released.</li>
<li>In order for communities of color, who are overwhemingly affected by police violence, to trust law enforcement, not giving them full transparency to body camera and dash camera footage does not build accountability and trust.</li>
<li>I urge Governor McCrory to veto HB 972. Thank you.
</li></ul>

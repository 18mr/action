## You're being connected!

Youâ€™ll receive a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- You can ask your senator to:
- Publicly OPPOSE Jeff Sessions for Attorney General due to his racist, sexist, and pro-corporate track record.
- Insist on the full 30 hours of debate for his nomination.
- Thank them for their time.

Thank you for your support!

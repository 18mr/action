			<p>In May, we demanded United Airlines stop treating its catering workers as second class and to let them unionize. <b> With the support of members like you, we won! Starting on September 18th 2018, United Airlines catering workers will begin their elections to officially unionize.</b> </p>

			<p><b>This is the moment of triumph we’ve waited for for seven months.</b> In January 2018, over 76% of all catering workers in the five kitchens -- Denver, Newark, Houston, Honolulu and Cleveland -- voted to have their own union elections. <b> Immigrants and people of color make up over 95% of United Airlines catering workers in Denver, 35% of the United Catering Operations workers are from the Pacific Islands and and 11% are Asian. But, these workers are too often relegated to the hardest and lowest paid jobs. </b> Workers had overwhelmingly voted to unionize because workers deserve to be treated with respect and earn a living wage. </p> 

			<p><b>The National Mediation Board agreed with the workers and on August 22nd they rejected United’s racist claim that workers weren’t capable of reading and understanding their union cards. </b> Even though United lost, they are still using intimidation tactics to suppress the vote. United said they respect their worker’s right to unionize, but they are spamming workers with anti-union propaganda and threatening to pull benefits. </p> 

			<p><b>United Catering workers and their families are counting on us to keep United accountable during the next six weeks of union elections until October 23rd. Will you tell United AIrlines to stop the intimidation tactics and let workers unionize?</b></p>

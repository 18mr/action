## You're being connected!

You’ll recieve a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press POUND or HASH (#) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- Ask the Senator to support S2275, the Adoptee Citizenship Act.
- The Act grants citizenship to people who should have been citizens all along--those who were adopted as children from other countries and have grown up and lived in the U.S. their entire lives.
- The Act will help tens of thousands of stateless adoptees who have been unable to find permanent work, start families, participate in civic life, and be full participants in our communities.
- The Act has bipartisan support.
- Mention any personal connection you have: such as if you’re an adoptee or an adoptive parent, or have adopted family members.
- Thank them for their time.

Thank you for your support!

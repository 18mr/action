## You're being connected!
<b>Here are some quick tips and facts to keep in mind as you prepare to talk to your Senator’s staff:<br></b>
<ul>
<li>You are asking your Senator to support the Every Person Counts Act.</li>
<br>
<li>The Every Person Counts Act makes it clear that each decennial census is meant to count the total number of people in the United States. It mandates that no information regarding citizenship or immigration status could be collected.</li>
<br>
<li>If you have one, it’s great to share a personal story about why the Census is important to you, your family, or your community.</li> </ul>

## Example Script

*Hi my name is _____________,  
I am a member of [name of your organization], and live in the district.  
I am deeply concerned about the citizenship question on the census. Immigrants are important members of our community who deserve resources and representation. The census determines funding for our states including resources and planning for our schools, hospitals, and transportation needs. <br>
The citizenship question creates unnecessary fear in our communities and a barrier to being counted. Our whole state will be affected by the citizenship question resulting in underfunding and potential cuts to representation for our state. <br>
I’m asking Senator ___________ to co-sponsor the Every Person Counts Act in the Senate.*

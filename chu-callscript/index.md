## You're being connected!

You'll get a call from us shortly with further instructions.

__Here's the call script you'll hear before you connect to Rep. Chu's office.__

<div class="featurebox">
<ul class="script">
<li>I’m calling to ask Representative Judy Chu to stand up for Asian American & Pacific Islander communities on net neutrality.</li>
<li>Thank you for defending the FCC’s authority to create and enforce regulations on net neutrality in the past.</li>
<li>Even after last month’s ruling, the fight isn’t over--March 25’s House Judiciary Committee hearing is an attempt to undermine FCC authority.</li>
<li>The internet is an important connector for the economic, social, civic, and artistic health of our communities, and Title II is the simplest, strongest solution to ensure we get fair, open access.</li>
<li>Net neutrality isn’t just an issue for techies and business: it’s a civil rights issue. Those struggling for civil rights today, including those in the AAPI community, have all joined the call for Title II.</li>
<li>We need Rep. Chu’s help in blocking any attempts to overturn the FCC decision or strip the FCC of its power to enforce Title II.</li>
<li>I’m calling to ask Representative Judy Chu to be a champion for AAPI communities by speaking up to protect net neutrality.</li>
</ul>

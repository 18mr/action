<li> Iâ€™m calling to ask (Senator's name) to pass AB 1726.</li>
<li> AB 1726 would disaggregate health data to ensure that all AAPI communities receive the support and services they need to thrive. The model minority myth erases the challenges marginalized AAPI communities experience.</li>
<li>AB 1726 would finally show the health disparities within our communities.</li>
<li> I strongly urge (Senator's name) to pass AB 1726. Thank you.</li></ul></div>

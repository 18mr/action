## You're being connected! If you don't receive a call, call 202-838-4698!

You’ll receive a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:
- Congress must pass a clean DREAM ACT.
- Twenty percent of the 800,000 DACA recipients are Asian American.
- It would be morally reprehensible for Congress to include enforcement measures in the DREAM Act because this effectively asks DACA recipients to choose themselves over their parents, tearing their families apart.
- We cannot allow DACA recipients to be bargaining chips for Trump to build his wall and terrorize border communities.
- DACA recipients have followed the steps the government has outlined for them. Now it’s time for the government to seek a permanent fix to help Dreamers stay in the country they grew up calling home.
- **And then urge them to vote for a clean DREAM Act.**

Thank you for your support!

## When you're done...

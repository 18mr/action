## You're being connected!

You'll get a call from us shortly with further instructions. _If you don't receive a call, you can call ICE Director Sarah Saldana directly at 202-732-3000 and ICE Field Director Craig Meyer at 415-844-5690._

__Here's a call script you can use to speak with ICE officials.__

<div class="featurebox">
I am calling to urge you to release Nan-Hui Jo (number A098 906 641). She is a survivor of domestic violence and has U-Visa and Violence Against Women Act petitions in process. Further, because there is an ongoing custody dispute, if ICE were to intervene and deport Ms. Jo, it could mean permanent separation between mother and child. Moreover, Ms. Jo’s case falls squarely into ICE’s parental interests directive from August 23, 2013, which require that the agency’s practices do not interfere with an individual’s parental rights. Please exercise discretion and release her from detention. Thank you.

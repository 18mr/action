Hello, I am calling for County Attorney John Choi.

I am calling on behalf of Chamroeun Phan.  In the press on August 29, Mr. Choi's Spokesperson, Dennis G, said that he can file a motion to the judge.  Mr. Phan’s attorney has filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief with the Ramsey County District Court.  I am calling to urge Mr. Choi to do three things: (1) to allow a Judge to decide the issues raised by the Petition and to not argue that the Petition has been filed too late; (2) to promptly file an Answer to the Petition, making clear that the County Attorney agrees that the issues raised may be decided by the Judge; (3) to agree that this matter can be scheduled for a hearing at the first available date on the Court’s schedule.  Thank you.

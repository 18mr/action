## You're being connected!

Youâ€™ll recieve a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- Ask where the Senator or Representative stands on Michael Flynn's appointment as National Security Advisor, if you don't know.
- *If they oppose Michael Flynn's appointment,* thank them for their support.
- *If they have no position or support Michael Flynn's appointment,* let the staffer know that you don't think Flynn is a good choice because of his disregard for facts, willingness to ignore security protocols, and relationship with far-right ideologues, and that as a constituent you are horrified that his influence could shape U.S. military policy the next four years.
- Encorage the Senator or Representative to speak out against the appointment.
- Emphasize that people like Flynn are a threat to both our country and the world, and we cannot let this appointment, or others like it, slide.
- Thank them for their time.

Thank you for your support!

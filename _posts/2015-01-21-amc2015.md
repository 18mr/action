We're coordinating a Network Gathering at the [Allied Media Conference](http://amc.alliedmedia.org)! In order to make the gathering as inclusive as possible, we're raising money to offset the costs of 
travel to Detroit for our cohort of participants. Please give to support Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders organizing for racial justice.

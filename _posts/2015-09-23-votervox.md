We're breaking new ground in the development of [VoterVOX](http://votervox.org) for the 2016 Presidential election season. Not only is the tool an exciting new project for 18MR, but it’s also been called “[a manifestation of democracy](https://www.newamerica.org/the-weekly-wonk/this-is-what-democracy-sounds-like/),” “the only kind of civic tech, or democratic work, worth investing in.”

__We’ve already received $5,844 from supporters like you, who believe that democracy needs to come from the grassroots. You can join them by giving a tax-deductible contribution today.__

We’re so excited you’re joining us on our newest adventure.

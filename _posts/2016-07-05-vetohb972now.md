blurb: "NC state legislature passed HB972, a bill that would make body and dash cam footage NOT accessible to the public."
description: "In North Carolina this week, the state legislature passed House Bill 972: a bill that gives police departments direct control, and greater discretion, over how and under which circumstances this crucial video footage is released to the public. We have to convince Gov. Pat McCrory to veto the bill -- or it becomes the law."

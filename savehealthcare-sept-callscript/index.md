## You're being connected! If you don't receive a call, call 202-798-1373!

You’ll receive a phone call from us shortly. The audio prompts will guide you through the process. When you are done with a call, even if you leave a voice message, press STAR (*) and you will be connected to the next office.

Here are some talking points to be sure to cover:

- Tell the staffer your name and where you live.
- You can share with your Senators:
- Your or a loved one’s personal story of why ACA is important to you.
- That more than 32 million Americans would not have access to healthcare if ACA is repealed.
- 32 million Americans would lose access to preventative care, mental and reproductive health care.
- 14 million people will be kicked off Medicaid, and 17% of all Asian Americans and 34% of all NHPIs will lose this coverage.
- Since passing the ACA, the uninsured rate for AAs and NHPIs has been cut by 50%
- **And then urge them to vote NO on Graham-Cassidy and NO on ACA repeal.**

Thank you for your support!

<li>Net Neutrality rules defend average American’s rights online by preventing Internet Service Providers from discriminating against or blocking lawful content and applications.</li>
<li>The vast majority of Americans support Net Neutrality rules that ensure a level playing field for all voices online and a robust, innovative Internet economy.</li>
